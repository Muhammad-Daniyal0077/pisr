					<p>
						PISR was initially established in <strong>1966</strong> with only <strong>six students</strong> in a rented villa on
						<strong>Khazan Road, Riyadh</strong>, by five families of <strong>Pakistan Air Force officers</strong>. It shut
						down after a few months due to legal formalities but was re-established with <strong>28 students</strong> on
						<strong>January 10, 1968</strong>, under <strong>Pakistan Air Force supervision</strong>. <strong>Mr. Toor</strong>
						was appointed as the Principal, and on <strong>January 5, 1970</strong>, it was formally approved as an
						<strong>International Community School</strong>, thanks to the relentless contributions of prominent community
						members like <strong>Dr. Fazal ur Rehman Sheikh</strong>, <strong>Dr. Nasim Ghani</strong>, and <strong>Pakistan
							Armed Forces officers in Saudi Arabia</strong>.
					</p>
					<p>
						In <strong>1972</strong>, the school relocated to <strong>Nasriya</strong>, with <strong>Mr. Mohammad Amin</strong>
						as the Principal. It remained under <strong>Pakistan Armed Forces supervision until 1987</strong>. Later, its name
						was changed on the <strong>President of Pakistan's recommendation</strong>. From <strong>2001</strong>, under the
						<strong>Ministry of Education KSA's directive</strong>, the <strong>School Management Council</strong> was formed.
						Initially elected by parents and later selected by the <strong>Embassy of Pakistan</strong>, the council managed
						school affairs. Since <strong>1990</strong>, the school has been operational in <strong>two villas spanning an
							estimated 30,000 sq. m.</strong>, continuing its legacy of excellence in education.
